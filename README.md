# QA_PersonSearchLanguageData
This repo consists of the QA dataset collected for performing person search with natural language.

## About the dataset
We created a dataset for person search that consists of specific questions and answers about appearance of person images. All the images have been taken from the test set of CUHK-PEDES dataset, availabel from https://github.com/ShuangLI59/Person-Search-with-Natural-Language-Description.

Dataset consists of 400 images of 360 people. We hired 20 prticipants to answer 5 specific questions about the appearance of the person. So, each person has labelled 20 images. Average length of combined description for each image is 39.15.
